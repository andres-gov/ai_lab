      "detailedContent": "- This submission responds to the HHS Request for Information on accelerating AI adoption in clinical care, focusing on oncology as the highest-cost, highest-complexity use case\n- AI in healthcare has reached an inflection point\n  - The core challenge is no longer innovation or model performance, but execution at scale\n  - Despite record per-capita healthcare spending, the U.S. underperforms on outcomes, access, and equity\n  - These failures are starkly visible in cancer care through delayed access, fragmented decision-making, and inefficient use of clinical trials\n\n- Core Thesis: Clinical Trials as Care Infrastructure\n  - Clinical trials are among the most underutilized assets in U.S. healthcare\n  - Benefits of clinical trials:\n    - Provide cutting-edge therapy\n    - Shift costs from payers to sponsors\n    - Generate real-world evidence\n    - Preserve patient choice\n  - Yet most patients learn about trials too late—after prior authorization delays or disease progression\n  - This is a structural failure, not a technology gap\n  - AI enables a reversal: every eligible patient should receive a Trial and Pathway Report before prior authorization is approved\n  - Implementing \"trial-before-authorization\" would:\n    - Reduce unnecessary utilization\n    - Accelerate access to advanced care\n    - Preserve clinician and patient agency\n    - Deflate downstream costs\n\n- Execution Model: A Hub-and-Spoke National Architecture\n  - To move from pilots to scale, HHS should prioritize execution-ready models\n  - Massive Bio operates a national hub-and-spoke infrastructure purpose-built for this transformation\n  - The Hub functions as a federated AI orchestration layer that:\n    - Ingests patient-consented clinical and genomic data\n    - Maps evidence-based pathways\n    - Matches patients to clinical trials in real time\n    - Produces outputs that are auditable, explainable, and compatible with decentralized, hybrid, and just-in-time (JIT) trial designs\n  - The Spokes include:\n    - Community oncology practices\n    - Academic centers\n    - Patient advocacy organizations\n    - Sponsors and CROs\n    - Enables national scale without centralized data control while preserving privacy and local clinical autonomy\n  - Cost Deflation is achieved through:\n    - Decentralized and JIT trials\n    - Reduced unused infrastructure\n    - Trial-first pathways that allow sponsor-funded therapies to precede payer authorization cycles\n\n- Key Policy Recommendations for HHS\n  - 1. Establish Trial-First AI Pathways\n    - Explicitly support AI-generated trial and pathway reports prior to prior authorization\n    - Enable \"gold card\" mechanisms for real-time approval when evidence-based criteria are met\n    - Treat trial enrollment as a prior-auth exception\n  - 2. Align CMS Incentives\n    - Reimburse AI-enabled trial matching and care coordination via new CPT codes\n    - Integrate trial utilization into value-based care models (APMs, MIPS) to reward cost-deflation through sponsor-funded therapies\n  - 3. Create Safe Harbors for Validated AI\n    - Provide liability clarity for clinicians using HHS-certified AI tools\n    - Launch voluntary ONC certification to validate safety, bias mitigation, and interoperability\n  - 4. Fund National Demonstrations\n    - Shift from pilots to operational-scale demonstrations through public-private partnerships\n    - Including a coordinated national AI deployment effort (\"Genesis Project\" for health)\n  - 5. Enforce Interoperability\n    - Accelerate adoption of FHIR and mCODE\n    - Mandate bulk data access to support robust, representative AI training and benchmarking\n\n- Preserving Trust and Agency\n  - AI must expand choice, not constrain it\n  - The proposed model is consent-driven, privacy-by-design, and explicitly preserves physician autonomy\n  - AI informs but does not dictate\n  - Addressing provider barriers is essential for adoption:\n    - Data fragmentation\n    - Misaligned incentives\n    - Liability uncertainty\n  - Addressing patient priorities is essential for adoption:\n    - Clarity\n    - Access\n    - Personalization\n\n- Conclusion\n  - The next wave of healthcare AI will be defined not by better models, but by responsible operationalization at scale\n  - Treating clinical trials as care infrastructure and deploying AI as a coordination layer can reduce costs, accelerate access, and restore trust\n  - Massive Bio operates today as national infrastructure—not a pilot or an app—and stands ready to partner with HHS to implement this vision now\n\n- Note: PDF attachment could not be processed\n\n---",

Our EBMonFHIR Implementation Guide offers a ready-made solution for human-readable, machine-interpretable evidence sharing that enables clinician oversight while avoiding burdensome FDA regulation. HHS investment in standardized evidence-sharing infrastructure would create long-term market opportunities similar to how GPS standards enabled the navigation software industry.\n\n---",

      "mainConcerns": "- AI systems may generate selective, one-sided justifications after determining recommendations rather than providing comprehensive evidence\n- Current lack of standardized \"navigation system\" for healthcare evidence sharing limits CDS adoption and market development\n- Without comprehensive reporting of both benefits AND harms with certainty of evidence, AI recommendations may not support proper clinical judgment\n\n---",
      "notableExperiences": "- Developed working examples of structured evidence presentation for real clinical scenarios (ESAs for CKD patients with anemia on dialysis)\n- Created a \"net benefit calculator\" tool demonstrating how standardized evidence can support individualized shared decision making\n- Key regulatory insight: providing rationale/evidence for independent clinician review is the pathway to avoiding FDA regulation of CDS software\n- The distinction between comprehensive systematic evidence vs. post-hoc selective justification is critical for trustworthy AI recommendations\n\n---",
      "keyQuotations": "- \"If AI is determining the recommendation, it needs to provide a comprehensive systematic representation of the supporting evidence RATHER THAN selective one-sided justification generated after the recommendation is determined.\"\n- \"Navigation software (MapQuest, Google Maps) is far advanced today and used in nearly infinite ways because there are common expectations in data sharing with both human-interpretable and machine-interpretable interfaces.
