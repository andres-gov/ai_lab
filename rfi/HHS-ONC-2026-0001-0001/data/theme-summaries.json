      "executiveSummary": "Public comments on AI governance frameworks reveal strong consensus that current oversight approaches are inadequate for managing clinical AI throughout its lifecycle, with commenters uniformly advocating for governance structures that extend well beyond pre-deployment validation. The central tension lies between those emphasizing model-agnostic, output-focused governance versus those prioritizing enforceable contestability and remedy mechanisms. Commenters—predominantly from consulting and technical backgrounds—converge on treating AI as infrastructure requiring systematic governance rather than technology requiring simple adoption, though they diverge on whether transparency or accountability should be the primary enforcement lever.",

Nearly all commenters explicitly or implicitly reject governance frameworks that focus solely on initial approval or privacy protections, emphasizing the need for ongoing lifecycle management. EHY Consulting states directly that governance approaches focusing only on privacy or pre-deployment validation are insufficient to manage post-deployment drift, vendor updates, subcontractor access, and long-term learning accumulation. Sancian LLC advocates for governance-first adoption where governance must precede deployment.
