      "executiveSummary": "Public commenters demonstrate remarkable consensus that governance uncertainty—not technical capability—is the primary barrier to clinical AI adoption, with virtually all stakeholders calling for clearer accountability structures and standardized oversight frameworks. The central tension lies between those advocating for minimal, risk-proportionate governance baselines that leverage existing healthcare quality paradigms versus those seeking more prescriptive federal requirements including mandatory governance plans and conditions of participation. Across stakeholder types, there is strong agreement that AI should augment rather than replace human clinical judgment, and that governance must be treated as foundational infrastructure rather than an afterthought.",

          "text": "Governance uncertainty is the primary barrier to AI adoption. Nearly all commenters identify governance uncertainty—not technical limitations—as the central obstacle preventing healthcare organizations from moving forward with AI implementation. Representative examples include Onboard AI stating that AI adoption in clinical care is constrained less by technical capability and more by uncertainty about what constitutes reasonable governance, evaluation, and oversight. FERZ AI argues the fundamental barrier to AI adoption in clinical care is not AI capability—it is the inability to prove that an AI system's governance was functioning correctly at the time of any specific decision. Lumenex Advisory notes that adoption often stalls not because of model performance, but because of structural, financial, and organizational friction, characterizing this as an implementation and governance failure rather than a technology failure.",

      "executiveSummary": "There is remarkable consensus across all stakeholder types that workflow misfit—not technical performance—is the dominant barrier to AI adoption in healthcare, with commenters uniformly emphasizing that AI tools adding burden will fail regardless of accuracy. The central tension lies between AI's promise to reduce clinician burden and the paradox that organizations most needing relief are too strained to implement new solutions. Commenters strongly recommend prioritizing human-centered design, end-user involvement from development through deployment, and measuring success by cognitive load reduction and time returned to patient care rather than algorithmic performance alone.",
